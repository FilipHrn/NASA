            <h2>Top Five Technologies for Spacecraft to survive deep space</h2>
            <p>Below you can find information about top five technologies an spacecraft needs in order to survive deep space. Both distance and duration demands that the spacecraft inlcudes the systems that can be operated far from home, is capable of keeping astronauts alive in case of emergencies and yet the spacecraft has to be light enough that a rocket can launch it. <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/top-five-technologies-needed-for-a-spacecraft-to-survive-deep-space" target="_blank">Read&nbsp;More</a></p>

                <h3>Systems to live and breathe</h3>
                <p>Removing humidity and CO2 is very important to ensure air remains safe for crew breathing. Water condensation on the vehicle hardware is controlled to prevent water intrusion into sensitive equipment such as pressure structure.</p>
                <p>In the spaceship Orion which is desiged and equipped for long distance travels, there will be a high-tech system to remove the CO2 and humidity, it is also very important for these systems to take minimal mass and volume. Another factor that is good with Orion is that it will be equipped with spacesuits capable of keeping the crew alive for six days in case of emergency so it holds out all the way home.</p>
                <p>Even the small systems have to function realibly such as the ones that keeps astronauts in shape to counter the zero-gravity enviroment that can be unhealthy towards muscles and bones.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>Proper propulsion</h3>
                <p>The further a crew wants to venture into deep space, the better and more capable propulsion is required. The spaceship Orion has a service module that has 33 engines in various sizes. The main one is used to provide major manouvering capabilities and can fire strongly enough to exit moons oribt and return to earth, the other 32 are mainly used to steer and control Orion in orbit.</p>
                <p>Combined these engines have enough propulsion to wander to the moon and back. The spaceship also includes tanks that can hold nearly 2000 gallons of propellant, which is enough to handle the rigors of travel and has the ability to bring the crew home in variety of emergencies together with the engines.</p>

                <h3>The ability to hold off the heat</h3>
                <p>The farther a spacecraft travels in space, the more heat it generates as it returns. For a safe return, it requires technologies that can endure speeds 30 times faster than the sound and temperatures half as hot as the sun or twice as hot as molten lava.</p>
                <p>Orions heat enduring is aided by its advanced heat shield that is made with material called AVCOAT. It will help the spaceship to endure temperatures around 5000 farenheit which is required during reentry through Earths atmosphere.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>Radiation protection</h3>
                <p>As the spacecraft travels out of the Earths orbit and away from its magnetic field, it gets exposed to harsher radiation enviroment with greater amounts of radiation from charged particles and solar storms. These radiations can cause disruptions in critical computers, avionics and other equipment/</p>
                <p>When it comes to humans, such radiation can cause both acute and chronic health problems ranging from near-term sickess or developing cancer in the long-term. Orion is equipped with four identical computers that are self-checking, in addition to those, it has an entirely different computer to ensure that commands can still be sent in th event of a disruption.</p>
                <p>All the equipment has been tested to a high standard to ensure that all critical systems endure any harsh conditions and remain operable.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>Constant communication and navigation</h3>
                <p>Spacraft that ventures deeper in the space will go beyond Global Positioning System (GPS) and also beyond communication satellites in Earth orbit. In order to keep the communication with the base in Houston ongoing, NASA will use their space communication networks.</p>
                <p>As they approach cislunar space, Orion will switch from the Near Earth Network to the Space Network, and finally to the Deep Space Network. Orion is also equipped with a backup navigation system which uses camera to take pictures of the Earth, Moon and stars and autonomously triangulate Orions position from the photos. This is a emergency backup in case of primary failure.</p>
